Question 2: Question 2: You won’t get caught if you hide behind someone.” Sang-Woo 
advises Gi-Hun to hide behind someone to avoid getting shot. Gi-Hun follows 
Sang-Woo's advice and hides behind Ali, who saved his life earlier. Gi-Hun 
and Ali both have the same height, K . Many players saw this trick and also 
started hiding behind Ali. Now, there are N players standing between Gi-Hun 
and Ali in a straight line, with the ith player having height Hi . Gi-Hun 
wants to know the minimum number of players who need to get shot so that 
Ali is visible in his line of sight.

Solution: 

def min_players_to_shot(T, test_cases):
 results = []
 for N, K, heights in test_cases:
 max_height = K
 players_to_shot = 0
 for height in heights:
 if height > max_height:
 players_to_shot += 1
 max_height = height
 results.append(players_to_shot)
 return results
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
 N, K = map(int, input().split())
 heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
 test_cases.append((N, K, heights))
results = min_players_to_shot(T, test_cases)
for result in results:
 print(result)
